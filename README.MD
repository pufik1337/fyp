# A Simple and Fast Implementation of Faster R-CNN

## 1. Introduction

Faster R-CNN adaptation for 6D Object Pose Estimation, based on https://github.com/chenyuntc/simple-faster-rcnn-pytorch/

Visualization and evaluation scripts use code from https://github.com/thodan/sixd_toolkit

RoI Align layer is based on https://github.com/longcw/RoIAlign.pytorch
